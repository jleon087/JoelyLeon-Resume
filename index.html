        <p class="lead mb-4">As I was  growing up I always wanted to succeed in life doing the things I love the most. It’s hard to stick to one thing and focus on that because I enjoy doing many things. I’ve always liked trying new things because you never know one day you will find out doing something you never expected doing and turns out you enjoy it. When I was younger I hated doing certain stuff and now I’m probably doing the things I hated doing as a kid. In my family I was always the one who wanted to help out with everything. I enjoyed working and helping others growing up because my mom will always include me in the things she will do and I picked it up from there. I knew if I do the right thing and help others, something will repay me back or it just felt good helping others for the ones in need because it shows how much you care. <br><br>

        Once I was in high school, I wanted to take advantage of the free time I had and to try something new. I didn’t know whether to volunteer or start training to work somewhere. When I found out I can do things where I can get paid I thought that was amazing. I first started babysitting since I’ve babysit my nieces and cousins many times and I never found that hard. On top of that, I just enjoyed spending time with the younger ones because I just find them so interesting and adorable. You’ll be surprised what you can learn from toddlers. I did a lot of activities with my nieces and cousin and they were able to build many skills that I wanted to show to the kids I was babysitting. I will enjoy hanging out with the kids I was babysitting because they always had a great time just spending it around with me. The kids enjoyed mainly doing arts and crafts because they never knew about it until I babysit them. It feels so amazing to show kids things they never knew about because that’s how they build hobbies and now they know the things they enjoy doing. I knew babysitting at a young age was crazy but I knew one day once I’m older I would want to have kids and be able to do activities with the kids I babysit, one day I could show it to my kids and hopefully they will enjoy it as much as the kids I babysit. <br><br>

       
        Once I graduated from high school, I knew I wanted to go to college and I ended up getting accepted to my dream college. I was going to the University of California, Riverside as an English major. I did graduate from University of California, Riverside with my bachelors degree. After graduating, I didn’t know what to do so I began working as a makeup artist. Since I was a teenager I enjoyed doing my own makeup and then it just became something I enjoyed doing on myself and others. As a kid, I would always go to my mom’s room and play with her makeup and pretend I was a makeup artist for celebrities. I never thought I would pursue a career with makeup since it wasn’t a major thing when I was young. I will practice doing makeup on my family members and they all thought I was talented and should pursue that. I thought they were crazy because I always had a passion for English and wanted to stick to that. After graduating college, I decided to work at a Boutique Salon and immediately fell in love since all my clients made me feel as the most talented makeup artist of all time. It did take a lot of time for me to get to where I am but I knew if I enjoyed doing makeup, the timing won’t affect anything at all as long I know I want to keep doing this for the rest of my life. I learned so much from being a makeup artist. I developed so many skills that I never knew once until I started working there. There are so many people that recommended me to others which is how my business started growing and I was so shocked because I knew I did it. I was able to succeed in the thing I most wanted to do. <br><br>
